Justus Brown Report

This is a basic showing of how socket programming works. The design
is fairly simple. The user enters in information from some terminal
with some given options and then if the server is running, it will
determine if all input from the client, excluding new line characters 
are palindromes. On the server side, the calculations are done and then
are sent back to the client.

My role in this project was to write the program for the interaction.
